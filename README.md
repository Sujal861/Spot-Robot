# Spot Robot Mechanical Design

## Overview
This repository contains the mechanical design for the Spot Robot, created using Autodesk Fusion 360. The design focuses on the structural components and assemblies of a quadruped robot inspired by Boston Dynamics Spot, intended for prototyping and further development.

## Contents
- Fusion 360 design file(s) (.f3d) including 3D models and assemblies of the Spot Robot
- Mechanical parts and assembly components modeled for fabrication or simulation

## Software Requirement
- **Autodesk Fusion 360** (latest version recommended) is required to open, view, and edit the design files

## Usage

### Opening the Design
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Autodesk Fusion 360
3. Import the `.f3d` file(s) into your Fusion 360 workspace
4. Explore the 3D model, assemblies, and individual components

### Working with the Model
- **View**: Navigate through the design to understand the robot's mechanical structure
- **Modify**: Edit components or assemblies to customize the design for your specific needs
- **Export**: Generate files for 3D printing, CNC machining, or other fabrication processes
- **Analyze**: Use Fusion 360's simulation tools to test mechanical properties and performance

## Features
- Complete quadruped robot mechanical assembly
- Detailed component modeling for all major structural elements
- Optimized design for potential fabrication and assembly
- Modular structure allowing for easy customization and improvements

## Project Purpose
- Provide a foundational mechanical design for a Spot-like quadruped robot
